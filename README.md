### **Introduction**

This project explores the aviation industry as a potential area for expansion and investment by analyzing historical data on aircraft incidents and accidents. 

By examining patterns in the data, the goal is to identify the safest aircraft makes, models, and engine types, as well as the most critical phases of flight in terms of safety.

This analysis will support informed decision-making for purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private purposes.

### **Objectives**

-To identify the lowest risk aircraft makes and models based on historical accident and injury data.

-To analyze the phases of flight to determine which are most associated with higher risks of accidents and injuries.

-To provide recommendations on aircraft selection and operational focus areas to minimize safety risks and maximize investment returns in the aviation sector.

### **Data**

The dataset utilized in this project is provided by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), encompassing civil aviation accident and selected incident data from 1962 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset includes detailed information about each event, including but not limited to the aircraft make and model, phase of flight, injury severity, and environmental conditions at the time of the incident.

### **Methods**

The analysis involved several key steps, including:
     
* data cleaning
* exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* statistical analysis. 

 The methodologies applied aimed to uncover patterns and insights through a data-driven approach, employing various statistical tools and visualization techniques to support the findings.

### **Results**

**Safest Aircraft:* The analysis highlighted Cessna (single-engine) and Piper (dual-engine) aircraft as having the lowest percentages of injuries, suggesting they are among the safest choices for investment.

**Critical Phases of Flight:* Cruise, Takeoff, and Maneuvering were identified as most prone to incidents and injuries, emphasizing the importance of focused safety measures and training in these areas.

### **Conclusion & Recommendations for Aviation Industry Expansion**

**Personal Aircraft Selection:** Favor Cessna (single-engine) and Piper (dual-engine) for lower injury percentages in personal flight phase.

**Commercial & Military Aircraft Selection:** Opt for Airbus for commercial and Lockheed for military uses due to lower injury rates compared to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.

**Phase of Flight Safety Analysis:** Highest injury rates found during Cruise, Takeoff, and Maneuvering phases.

**Engine Type Insight:** Cessna with Reciprocating 1 engine shows the best safety margin based on incidents vs. injury percentage.


### **Next Steps for Informed Decision-Making:**

**Comprehensive Risk Assessment:** Broaden analysis to include more aircraft types, maintenance history, and operational performance.

**Advanced Accident Prediction:** Employ machine learning for accident and injury likelihood prediction.

**Training & Safety Program Evaluation:** Review and enhance training and safety programs, focusing on high-risk flight phases and aircraft types.
